# Plane Ahead!

Priority queue for planes. ✈️

## Issue
Air traffic has increased dramatically in recent years, putting additional pressure on air traffic controllers who have to handle thousands of flights daily. We need efficient systems to avoid delays and accidents. In the event of emergencies, air traffic controllers need to be able to react swiftly and prioritize certain flights to ensure the safety of passengers.

## Our Project
We have implemented a priority queue to manage the flights departing from and arriving at an airport. This allows the air traffic controllers to find the mostly urgent flights quickly and efficiently, considering emergencies and other concerns like fuel level. Flights which need to land or take off urgently will be placed at the front of the queue, preventing any potentially life-threatening delays. 

This priority queue is implemented in a user friendly GUI using JavaFX from the perspective of the air control tower. We hope that in the face of stress of keeping our skies safe, you would have an a fun and easy experience with our interative and easy to use system.
